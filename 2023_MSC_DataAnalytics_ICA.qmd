You are required to write **three** core SQL queries to perform the following tasks:

1. List all projects that were completed in the last two years and involved more than three animation assets.
2. List the average development time for projects, categorized by the number of assets used.
3. List the top three developers based on the number of successful projects they've been involved in.

You are also required to demonstrate the following **three** SQL concepts using no fewer than **three** distinct SQL statements:

1. SELECT with LIKE and OR
2. SELECT with DISTINCT and ORDER BY
3. Subquery with SELECT

Output the results in formatted table(s) in a Quarto Notebook file inside a **Quarto Project**.

### Part B - Linear Regression (20 Marks)

Utilise the provided dataset, which contains details about project budgets, timelines, team sizes, and success rates and apply linear regression analysis to understand trends or patterns in the game development lifecycle. 

You are required to perform the following tasks:

1. Perform linear regression to predict the success rate of a project based on its budget **and** team size and present the data in an appropriate plot.
2. Interpret the model coefficients and discuss what insights they provide about game development.
3. Comment on the reliability of the the linear regression model and any outliers present in the data.

Output the results in a Quarto Notebook file inside a **Quarto Project**.

### Part C - Interactive Web Application (30 Marks)

Create an interactive web application using Quarto and Shiny to display and interact with data from the database. 

You are required develop an interactive web web application containing **two** pages/tabs which allow the following:

1. The first page/tab should allow the user to view the contents of the five tables in the database with no filtering or queries executed.
2. The second page/tab should allow users to visualize data through 2-3 appropriate plots and interact with at least 1 plot by hovering over the data presented. Typically, plots could include data related to project timelines, budget utilization, success rates, etc.
3. The second page/tab should allow for user interaction, such as selecting specific projects or developers to view more detailed data. You must include a minimum of 2 fields for interaction (e.g., textfield, dropdown, slider, checkbox) for each plot.

Output the results in a properly a **Quarto Project**. The web application does not need to be published to a remote server and may be run from your machine.

### Part D - Quality & Conclusions (20 Marks)

You are required to present Assess the student's ability to present a Quarto project containing three well-formatted documents. You will be assessed in terms of adherence to best practices in coding and data visualization and the quality of your conclusion. The assessment criteria for this component are listed below:

#### Document Formatting (5 Marks)

- Overall structure and organization of the report.
- Effective use of headings, subheadings, and bullet points.
- Consistency in font, spacing, and margins.
- Proper pagination and table of contents (if applicable).

#### Suitability of Tables in Part A (5 Marks)

- Clarity and readability of tables.
- Appropriate labeling for tables.
- Consistent and legible formatting in tables and figures.

#### Suitability of Plots in Part B (5 Marks)

- Relevance and effectiveness of chosen plots to represent the data.
- Ability to convey the intended message or findings clearly.
- Innovative and insightful use of data visualization techniques.

#### Adherence to Best Practices in Coding and Data Visualization (5 Marks)

- Code clarity, including commenting and organization.
- Use of efficient and appropriate coding methods.
- Adherence to data visualization best practices, including color choice, scale, and avoiding misleading representations.

#### Conclusion and Reflection (5 Marks)

- Inclusion of a 1-2 paragraph Conclusion section.
- Depth of reflection on what was learned from each part of the assignment.
- Insightful discussion on how the skills and knowledge gained apply to game development and computer animation.

## Version Control Requirements

You must use a recognised online code repository (e.g., GitHub) and make regular well-named commits to your private repository. A link to your code repo must be included in a README as part of the final submission and you must add your lecturer as a developer to the repository. The repository must be named *2023_DAIE_ICA_StudentInitials*.

Your grade for this component will depend directly upon the **regularity** of your commits. A development project of this size should consist of a minimum of **5+ distinct commit messages** spread over the lifetime of the development. Committing all your code in one commit, before the deadline, will be interpreted negatively.

**Any submission made which does not include a repository link will not be graded.**

## Submission Requirements

1.  A link to your R source code repository. Ensure that **no** changes are made to the repository following the submission deadline. You should create a separate fork for this submission and leave it unchanged after the deadline. Ask your lecturer for details on fork creation.
2.  The assignment must be entirely the work of each student. Students are **not** permitted to share any pseudocode or source code from their solution with any other group in the class.
3.  Students may **not** distribute the source code of their solution to any other student, in any format (i.e., electronic, verbal, or hardcopy transmission).
4.  Plagiarised assignments will receive a mark of **zero**. This also applies to the individual/group allowing their work to be plagiarised. Any plagiarism will be reported to the Head of Department and a report will be added to your permanent academic record.
5.  Late assignments will **only** be accepted if accompanied by the appropriate medical note. This documentation must be received within 10 working days of the project deadline. The Institute standard penalties for late submission will apply.
6.  Each student **must** complete and **sign** a single assignment cover sheet. Please submit the signed cover sheet before 5 pm on the Friday of the week of the deadline.
